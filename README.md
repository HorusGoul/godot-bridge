# godot-bridge

## How to use

The easiest way right now to use this is to create a project that uses the Vite template:

```bash
npx degit HorusGoul/godot-vite-template#main my-project
```

Then, launch the vite server which can be found inside the `gui` folder with the `yarn dev` command.

After that, open Godot and launch the project using the HTML5 export.
